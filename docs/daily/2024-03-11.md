Today I'm focused on improving our speed and reaching [[Tokenspeed]], which I refer to as the property of one's organization working at the speed of LLM tokens.  In this sense, our task can be as removing blockages to such speed [[via negativa]].

Specifically, I'm working on a system to gather richer context about the organization state such that it can be fed into prompts and I don't need to explain things.  I hope this gets me tapping LLMs much more, and building entire workflow pipelines to remove myself from things that can and should be automated: design ideation, marketing, outreach strategy, refining and debating ideas, coding, prioritization, financial models.  Think big.  Context and workflows can compound.  Integrations with stripe, with my database, and other services means can have agents working with full context across my org, constantly spotting opportunities.
