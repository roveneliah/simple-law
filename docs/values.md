## Our Values

> "The best way to get what you want is to deserve what you want." - Charlie Munger

We are focused on creating massive value for our clients and lawyers.

### Lawyer Mission Statement

We help lawyers make more money more easily. We do this via subtraction of business processes that benefit from operations of scale, and by providing a platform that allows lawyers to focus on the most valuable work they do. On a subjective side, we remove tediousness, and help make their day more meaningful and enjoyable via providing value to clients.

#### Products

1. Matches: We charge lawyers a flat rate for matches, not leads. This means we're an incentive aligned partner, not a middleman.

### Client Mission Statement

For clients, we're heading towards end-to-end solving and prevention of their problems. On the subjective side, we're eliminating **uncertainty** over (1) if they're doing things right, (2) if they're getting good value, (3) the value and quality of the legal services they are receiving.

> Via Negativa

We believe in the power of subtraction. We believe that the best way to solve a problem and create great products is via subtraction. Let technology get things out of the way. In the context of law, that means

## Articulating Who We Are

It's critical we're able to communicate to clients and lawyers who we are and what we stand for. This is a testing ground for talking points, memes, key metaphors, analogies, and symbolism.

- Step by step by step by step. Playing for the long haul involves putting our heads down over a very long period of time. Most people can't stay sane and focused for that long. We can. We're the tortoise. This is a different way of doing things—consistency, patience, and a focus on the long term. Don't burn out, don't wear yourself out.
- "THAT GOOD" (For Lawyers, we want to give them that feeling that they're getting such insane value that we don't even need to do marketing—and that we WON'T do marketing because we're THAT GOOD.)
- (Ultimately we want to rebrand law as something cool, making everyone feel like a boss, like they're the main character, like they're in control, like they're not the prey.)
- (Focusing on addition via subtraction)
- To Investors, we want them to see us as an extensible, modular protocol or marketplace. A good metaphor for this is TCP/IP for law.

## How We Do Things, What Makes IL Different

- Spartans, Service. We recognize that every dollar spent wastefully is value taken from those we're serving. We're fighting for our clients, and constantly monitoring ourselves and calling out decadence in our spending, and ensuring we're staying close to the customers.
- Survive. We are not a growth-first startup. We are a survival first cybernetic complex, believing in the power of compounding and implicit organizational excellence to reap massive rewards in the long haul. With compounding, everything is reaped at the end. Thus, we are focused on the long term, and are willing to sacrifice short term gains for long term gains. Our aesthetic is spartan, humble, and focused on compounding growth in a few timeless things—talent, speed, quality, cost.
- We hire based on opportunity, not need. Talent is everything, and we're willing to hold back growth if that would main tainting A++ talent pool.
