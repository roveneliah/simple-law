# ImpossibleLaw

ImpossibleLaw is a marketplace for legal services. We connect clients with legal services, offering a new way to shop for legal services. Specifically, we are attempting to remove the uncertainty and insider knowledge required to navigate legal matters skillfully, and have assurance that one is getting good value. In doing so, we are attempting to make shopping for legal services more like the typical online shopping experience consumers are accustomed to.

From the business angle, we are like a Costco for lawyers, providing them insane value for their membership, and a steady stream of clients. We also remove the tediousness of online platforms and their rating systems, where client star reviews and comments can be unfair to lawyers. Instead, we align our incentives with lawyers by charging for matches, not leads. We charge a flat fee for each match.

The magic of our business is that leads can flow in from multiple sources, meaning we can spin up multiple brands and experiments to bring in leads. This means we can go after different markets with different brands. We can also go after consumers, businesses, and even general counsels differently. We can experiment at low cost under one specific brand. We can even partner with other platforms to bring in leads. This also allow us to better incentivize managers based on their platform alone.
